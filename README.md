### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I just enrolled in a data science full-time bootcamp and I'm super excited to get started!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking to develop and collaborate on projects that can better the world
- ðŸ”­ Machine learning will be my focus
- âš¡ Fun fact: I chose the in-person bootcamp in Madrid one week and moved there the following week. Gotta move fast!
